    <p>Hi! My name is Tommy. I am a Junior at Michigan State University majoring in Games and Interactive Media. I grew up in a small town about an hour away from campus, and have been living on campus for two years. I am interested in being either a Game Designer or a Level Designer after college, but truthfully have not nailed down exactly what I will do.</p>

    <p>Outside of school and work, I enjoy playing video games and hanging out with friends. By far my favorite seasons are fall or winter, as I really enjoy being cold rather than being hot or sweaty. Hoping life turns out well, just like the rest of us!</p>
